title: From Circuits to Cloud, a Chameleon Code Warrior
description: 'About Me'

Think of me as a shapeshifter of code, a tireless learner with a chameleon's knack for adapting to new environments. I'm Hilman Mustofa, a Cloud Engineer whose journey began amidst the intricate symphony of <b>Telecommunications</b>, deciphering the language of circuits and signals. But my restless spirit craved a different tune, so I morphed into a <b>Security Analyst</b>, guarding the digital domain with the keen eyes of a vigilant sentinel.

Yet, the call to create beckoned. I yearned to build, not just protect, so I embarked on a daring metamorphosis, transforming into a <b>Finance Staff</b>. But spreadsheets weren't my sole language; I spoke the fluent dialect of code! Using the Google Stack, I crafted a mini ERP for the company, proving that elegance can bloom even in unexpected gardens. This transformation not only honed my analytical skills but also ignited a passion for building efficient solutions.

But the cloud's alluring whisper proved irresistible. Its boundless skies and agile landscapes lured me, and I spread my wings once more, emerging as a <b>Cloud Engineer</b>. The Cloud Resume Challenge became my proving ground, where I spun a fully functional static site with Azure Static Web (using the free plan, no magic tricks involved!). It was a trial by code, yes, but one that solidified my confidence and fueled my thirst for innovation.

##### So, what fuels my digital evolution?

* <b>Curiosity</b>: My mind is a sponge, soaking up new challenges like a parched land gulps rain. Every problem is a puzzle waiting to be cracked, every technology a portal to uncharted territories.
* <b>Agility</b>: I'm a master of change, blending seamlessly into new environments and mastering diverse domains. From circuits to code, spreadsheets to serverless, I thrive on the thrill of adaptation.
* <b>Impact</b>: Building elegant solutions isn't just about technical prowess; it's about creating ripples of positive change. That's the wind that truly lifts me up.

##### What you'll find here:

This blog is my playground, where I share the adventures of a cloud chameleon:
